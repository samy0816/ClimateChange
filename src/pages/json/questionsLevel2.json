    "options": [
      "Increase in forest area",
      "Decrease in forest area",
      "No change in forest area"
    ],
    "answer": "Decrease in forest area",
    "reason": "Urbanization often requires land for construction and development, which can lead to deforestation and a reduction in forest areas.",
    "hint": "Urbanization usually involves clearing land for buildings and infrastructure.",

    "question": "Which of the following is a direct consequence of increased global temperatures?",
    "options": [
      "Decrease in sea levels",
      "Increase in forest fires",
      "Decrease in plastic usage"
    ],
    "answer": "Increase in forest fires",
    "reason": "Higher global temperatures can lead to drier conditions and prolonged heatwaves, increasing the likelihood and intensity of forest fires.",

    "id": 5,
    "question": "Considering the impact of plastic usage on the environment, what would be a more sustainable alternative?",
    "options": [
      "Using more plastic for convenience",
      "Recycling and using biodegradable materials",
      "Dumping plastic in the oceans"
    ],
    "answer": "Recycling and using biodegradable materials",
    "reason": "Recycling helps reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and oceans, and biodegradable materials break down more easily, minimizing environmental pollution.",

    "id": 6,
    "question": "Propose a strategy that could simultaneously reduce global temperatures and benefit terrestrial animals.",
    "options": [
      "Increase urbanization",
      "Reduce fossil fuel burning",
      "Plant more forests"
    ],
    "answer": "Plant more forests",
    "reason": "Planting forests increases carbon sequestration, helping to cool the planet, and provides habitat for terrestrial animals, promoting biodiversity.",
    "hint": "Consider strategies that both sequester carbon and provide habitats.",

  {
    "id": 7,
    "question": "What happens to terrestrial and aerial animals when there is an increase in forest fires?",
    "options": [
      "Their populations increase",
      "Their populations decrease",
      "They migrate to urban areas"
    ],
    "answer": "Their populations decrease",
    "reason": "Forest fires destroy habitats and food sources, leading to a decline in animal populations due to death and displacement.",
    "hint": "Think about the impact of habitat destruction on animal populations.",
    "category": "ClimateChange"
  },
  {
    "id": 8,
    "question": "Why does an increase in global temperatures lead to more frequent hurricanes?",
    "options": [
      "Higher temperatures create more oceanic evaporation",
      "Higher temperatures stabilize atmospheric conditions",
      "Higher temperatures reduce wind speeds"
    ],
    "answer": "Higher temperatures create more oceanic evaporation",
    "reason": "Warmer temperatures increase the rate of evaporation from the oceans, providing more moisture and energy for storms, leading to more frequent and intense hurricanes.",
    "hint": "Consider the relationship between ocean temperatures and storm formation.",
    "category": "ClimateChange"

  {
    "id": 9,
    "question": "If a coastal city is experiencing rising sea levels, which of the following is a potential impact on humans and terrestrial animals?",
    "options": [
      "Decreased risk of flooding",
      "Increased risk of habitat loss",
      "Improved living conditions"
    ],
    "answer": "Increased risk of habitat loss",
    "reason": "Rising sea levels can lead to coastal flooding, eroding habitats, and forcing both humans and animals to relocate, thereby increasing the risk of habitat loss.",
    "hint": "Think about the consequences of coastal flooding on habitats.",
    "category": "ClimateChange"

    "id": 10,
    "question": "How does deforestation affect terrestrial animals and the earth's climate?",
    "options": [
      "Improves habitats for terrestrial animals",
      "Increases carbon dioxide absorption",
      "Leads to loss of habitat and increased global temperatures"
    ],
    "answer": "Leads to loss of habitat and increased global temperatures",
    "reason": "Deforestation removes trees that absorb carbon dioxide, contributing to higher atmospheric CO2 levels and global warming, and it destroys habitats, negatively impacting terrestrial animals.",
    "hint": "Consider the dual impact of tree loss on carbon absorption and animal habitats.",
