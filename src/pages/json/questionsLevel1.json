      "Yes",
      "No",
      "Maybe"
    ],
    "answer": "Yes",

    "options": [
      "Yes",
      "No",
      "Uncertain"
    ],
    "answer": "Yes",
    "reason": "Causality - Emission Sources: Industrial facilities and vehicles both release greenhouse gases, and their combined emissions can significantly increase the overall concentration of these gases in the atmosphere.",

    "options": [
      "Yes",
      "No",
      "Possibly"
    ],
    "answer": "Yes",

    "options": [
      "Yes",
      "No",
      "Maybe"
    ],
    "answer": "Yes",
    "reason": "Causality - Land Use: Deforestation reduces the number of trees that can absorb carbon dioxide, leading to higher concentrations of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and contributing to global warming.",

      "Yes",
      "No",
      "Uncertain"
    ],
    "answer": "Yes",
